## Directions

Build your assigned component. (NavBar, Cta, Cards, or Footer) Be creative with content. No CSS / class structure is prebuilt, and it's not core to what we're practicing. You can find a recommended framework for your component in the comments in index.html, but feel free to change it as you please.

If you finish early, feel free to add some basic styling through the DOM!
